# GoogleScripts

This is my set of useful Google Sheet Scripts that i use daily.

I'm not a JavaScript pro, but since i'm a regular Google Sheets user i've been trying to increase my knowledge in this kind of stuff to make my work a little bit easier.

Therefore, i've decided to provide some of the scripts that have been really helpful to me. Hope they will be helpful to you too!

Obviously, i'm open to suggestions/corrections/improvements and, of course, new challenges!
